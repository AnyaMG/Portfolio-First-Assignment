<h3>About me:</h3>

<p>A Ukrainian-born New Yorker, I grew up in Queens and graduated from Hunter College with a BA in English Language Arts and
an unofficial minor in Japanese.</p>
<p>Not long after, I decided to switch my focus from language to creative work, ultimately
attending Make Up Designory in Soho and completing an intensive course in runway makeup artistry. It was after graduating
from Make Up Designory that I pursued a career at Sephora USA, starting out as a makeup facilitator and climbing my way up
into leadership after relocating to Atlanta.</p>
<p> Now, after five years, I've decided to try and leverage my two passions, language and the ability to create, 
to enter the field of software engineering! Ultimately I would love to continue my career at Sephora but as a developer, optimizing
the site for the ultimate browsing experience.</p>
